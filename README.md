To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I will design and build it with user experience in mind, using best practices, with succinct and non-repetitive code that is easily readable, including comments and notation, and wil design and implement a test regimen alongside the code itself to test functionality and code integrity. 

I will interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by taking into account all documented user needs, and design a program that meets all functional requirements based on those needs. I will then test the program software to ensure that all requirements are met and all user needs manifest in the finished product.

I will approach designing software taking into account the needs of all potential users, and the functionality necessary to fulfill those needs. I will also design software that is capable of performing as needed, with both speed and performance at optimal levels, with a commitment to improving the product with updates as needed.
